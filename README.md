These 2 ques are assignments.



1. Create a deployment running nginx version 1.16.1 that will run 2 pods that uses /var/www as its root dir. Nginx should run on port 8090. It should mounts a volume and the volume should have a dir /var/www and contain a file "Hello SCRIBETECH" html.
2. Write a simple python program, that would expose itself to port 80 with HELLO SCRIBETECH message. Then, write yaml manifest for it, deploy it to K8S and expose it using nginx ingress. Create a Canary and blue-green deployment for it. This Pod should load before Nginx (you need to prove this)
